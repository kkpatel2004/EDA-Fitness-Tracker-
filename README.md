Health & Habit EDA on Fitness Tracker

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on fitness tracker data to uncover insights about health and habits. The dataset contains information such as step count, heart rate, sleep patterns, calorie intake, and other lifestyle factors. The goal is to analyze and visualize trends to understand how habits impact overall health.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes user activity logs from fitness trackers.

Common attributes: steps, heart_rate, calories_burned, sleep_hours, activity_duration, exercise_type, etc.

Data source: Provide dataset source if applicable (e.g., Kaggle, Fitbit API, or simulated data).

🔍 Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key statistics of health metrics.

Visualization: Trends in step count, heart rate fluctuations, and sleep patterns.

Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships between different health indicators.

Habit Impact Study: Analyzing how daily habits (e.g., exercise, sleep) affect overall fitness.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

📊 Key Findings

Summarize interesting insights discovered during the analysis.

Example: "Users who sleep more than 7 hours tend to have a lower resting heart rate."
